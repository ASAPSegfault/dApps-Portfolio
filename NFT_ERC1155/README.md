# NFT_ERC1155 Contract And Visualiser

This project features a contract that has been used to create the Fellowship Of The Ring NFTs collection.
It makes use of OpenZeppelin contracts interfaces in order to have battle-tested code handling our precious NFTs.
It also comes with an NFT Visualiser where you can see each of NFT of the collection, along with their attributes.
You can also visualise them on OpenSea.

The project has been set up and deployed with Hardhat.
Metadata is pulled from the blockchain whereas NFT actual data (name, description, attributes...) is pulled from IPFS.

In order to use the NFT Visualiser, you must have Metamask installed on your browser or, if you have Brave browser, the internal wallet that is used inside the browser.
