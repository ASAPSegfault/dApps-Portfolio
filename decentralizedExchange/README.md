Decentralized ERC20 Exchange Contract and Frontend - EldoraDEX

This project features a contract that holds the logic for a decentralized exchange that allows to create limit and market orders with custom ERC20 tokens.

The project has been set up and deployed with Truffle.

In order to use the frontend, you must have Metamask installed on your browser or, if you have Brave browser, the internal wallet that is used inside the browser.
You also need to make sure Metamask/Brave is set to the Ropsten network.

Once this is done you can navigate to the frontend link below and start playing with the exchange.\n
You will be able to acquire free tokens from the faucet button on the exchange.
